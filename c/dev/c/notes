before arithmetic all narrow types are promoted to signed int

0x1.7AP-13 - Hexadecimal floating point constant

all numerical literals are positive, - just negates the value

decimal integer constant -> first signed type that fits (signed, long, long long)
hex or octal constant -> int if fits, otherwise smallest unsigned that fits (unsigned, unsigned long, unsigned long long)

I reserved for imaginary unit (0.5 + 0.5I)

unsigned >> signed
don't mix signs in operations

INITALIZE ALL VARS                                                             !

T a = {0} - works for every type

all constants with meaning have to be named
all constants with different meaning have to be distinguished

enumerations type = signed int
you can initalize enum with ICE
ICE (integer constant expression):
- doesnt evaluate any object
- can consist of: int literals, enumeration constants, _Alignof, offsetof, sizeof

#define CORVID_NAME /**/
(char const*const[corvid_num]) {
    [chough] = "chough",
}

there must be space between name and (), otherwise functional macro
compund literal defines an object

use unsiged for bit operations

use fixed length types where applicable

dont compare floating points for equality

an array with length thats not ICE is an VLA

in preprocessor conditions unknown identifiers evaluate to 0

%d - integer
%u - unsigned
%x - bit patterns
%g - floats

%+d, %#X, %a - conversions that have to ve read later

use as many asserts as necessary
use NDEBUG to switch off asserts

all pointer differences are of type ptrdiff_t

function decays to function pointer

sizeof(char) == 1   ALWAYS                                                     !
every object A can be viewed as unsigned char[sizeof A] (or uint8_t[sizeof A])

only pointers of the same type can alias
(exceptions: char pointers and void pointers <- should use restrict)           !

you can use objects by their effective type or pointer to char type

STORAGE CLASSES:
{
    - static (determined at compile time, valid for whole program duration)
    - automatic (automatically determined at runtime, default behaviour)
    - allocated (explicitly determined by malloc and friends)
    - thread (bound to certain thread of execution)
}

EXTERN keyword means this var should be linked by linker (either internal or external)
{
    (in file scope): {
        - declaration of var with linkage so there has to be somewhere
        ONE and only ONE definition
        - if it's in the same file the linkage is internal otherwise external
        - only used for vars
        - linker links this declaration after program startup (so the
        definition has to have static storage duration)
    },
    (in function scope): {
        - declaration of var with linkage
        - has to link against some definition with static storage duration
        - because it's linked at compile time
    },
    (GOOD PRACTICE): {
        - declare global vars that should be used in other files also
        with EXTERN keyword in header file
        - define them in corresponding translation unit? (.c file)
        - use them like normal vars in other files (after including header file),
        iff shadowed by local var (what shouldn't happen) use EXTERN keyword
    }
}

STATIC keyword means that var should have internal linkage
{
    (file scope): {
        - declares and defines object with internale linkage, which means
        it can't be linked from outside this file (file exclusive global objects)
    },
    (function scope): {
        - declares and defines var with static storage duration
    },
    (GOOD PRACTICE): {
        - declare and define global objects exclusive to one file with STATIC
    }
}

LINKAGE:
{
    variable with linkage is managed by linker and initalized at startup of the program
    EXTERNAL LINKAGE: identifiers accessed from different object files
    INTERNAL LINKAGE: a global, file scope object or function
    NO LINKAGE: otherwise (normal function scope vars)
}

STATIC STORAGE DURATION:
{
    - objects that are defined in file scope
    - variables from function blocks with storage class specifier STATIC
    - compound literals                                                        !
    - string literals                                                          !

    - have lifetime of entire program execution
    - can only be initialized with expressions known at compile time
    - are always initialized
}
