1. C programs consists of different types of text elements:
    - special words
    - punctuation (brackets and separators)
    - comments
    - literals (fixed values that are part of program code)
    - identifiers (data objects (variables), types, functions and constants)
    - functions (declaration and definition)
    - operators
2. Declarations = what identifier should represent. (what is this identifier + type)
3. Declarations are bound to the scope in which they appear (block or file).
4. Definitions = initialization of object. (place in memory + value)
5. Initialization augments declaration and provides initial value for object.
6. Statements are instructions that tell compiler what to do with identifiers that have been declared so far.

1. Conditional execution is supported using controlling expressions in if statements.
2. All scalars have truth value (0 is false, rest is true):
    - scalars are numerical types and also pointer types (size_t, ptrdiff_t and void*)
3. Case values in switch have to be ICE (integer constant exprssions).
